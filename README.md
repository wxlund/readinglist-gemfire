This is a combination of two efforts:

Started with Spring Starter Project. There was nothing really helpful in the starter project so combined the starter project with the gs-accessing-data-gemfire/complete from getting started guides. This project works but I wanted to merge with the small web application to gather the reading-list from the user. When I add in the two starters for the web app the application no longer works.

    compile('org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-thymeleaf')
    compile('org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web')
